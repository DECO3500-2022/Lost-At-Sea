## Summary:
The Coronavirus pandemic has forced global experimentation and shifted education to focus on its online opportunities. This is especially geared towards the potential of online learning for High School and University students. Each teammate contributing to this project researched unique domains, and all members voted on the specific domain of online learning in the context of COVID-19 geared towards High School and University students. This project intends to try to evoke people's awareness of the potential of online social learning and the tools which community-driven education software can provide. This is a very real human issue at stake and will require considered design and technological approaches. Applying tools learnt in the DECO3500 course, a social and emotional context is required to understand the  domain space. Our initial idea is to create an online system which can focus on community-driven education and competition to provide a unique learning experience for users. This will require extensive design requirements and user testing to be successful. Refer to the Plan of Work for more details.
