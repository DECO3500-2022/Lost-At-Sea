Team:

James McAuley
Studies Software Engineering at UQ. I am extremely interested in learning the design thought process and contributing what I can to produce a product for the exhibition. My strengths include working in a software focused professional workplace already and thus having experience with the team based product process. I also have experience with UX design and machine learning code which both have been fleshed out with the recent completion of my thesis. I definitely lack experience with the design thought process and what steps are involved into creating a product from an idea. For work, I usually get given ideas, a plan and a due date to complete the product (or section of code). I hope to achieve a working initial prototype which can be clearly shown in the exhibition for DECO3500. Ideally, this prototype can contribute to my and my team's project portfolios.

I am currently undergoing a degree program in Bachelor's of Information Technology at the University of Queensland, majoring in Software Design. I graduated with a Diploma in Information Technology back in Malaysia, and right after that, I took a course to study full-stack web development. With my qualifications, I worked at a company that develops online web services for business clients. During my time there, I developed several computer-vision and image processing services delivered via a microservice architecture. I would say my skill sets are more geared towards the back-end systems. Studying at UQ in Software Design opened my eyes to a more human-centred approach to develop complex systems and as a result, I would like to say I am more of a well-rounded person

Ferdi Sungkar
Studies a double degree program of Computer Science at University of Indonesia and Information Technology at UQ. Very keen to learn about the design process of creating a product and the way ideas can collaborate with each other in this course. Having worked at companies that produce various digital products have really helped my knowledge in working as a team and how to produce a product properly. Previously I have done another DECO course where we are needed to create a design of a product from scratch, but I feel that the work that was done still has a lot of things that can be improved. Hopefully by the end of this course I can feel satisfied with my work and with the help of my team learn more from each other's knowledge and experience to get the best product for the exhibition.

Ida Green Heglund
Studies Computer Engineering at NTNU, is currently at UQ on exchange. Having worked in teams on big application projects before, I believe I can be an attribute in knowing what needs to be done and when. Other strengths include being organised and efficient, which can help avoid unnecessary work. Weaknesses include not having had a DECO course before, and I am therefore a bit unsure about the scope of the course, what is required and layout of the final prototype. I hope to achieve a better understanding of what technologies can help improve education. I am also hoping to make a prototype that serves its purpose, and can be seen as a functional and good solution to the problem space described.
